Guidelines for Preparation and Testing

These plans can exist as either a part of the customer's process or as something that we bring through a contract – we maybe i
nternal employees and contractors or brought in as outside consultants.

In the first case, you maybe tasked with testing against your own employer's environment or products.

In this case, your orders will likely flow from internal processes or project requirements.

Ad hoc testing ordered by management isn't uncommon, but be sure that the scope and processes are formally agreed upon to ensure all parties are protected.

In the latter case, you or your employer may be hired by a customer to provide testing.

In these cases, the scope, Statement of Work (SOW), and contract, as a whole, will need to be vetted by both parties to ensure that boundaries are preserved.

Throughout the entire process,(a lo largo del proceso )  keep in mind why we are there – we're there to help the customers, not to humiliate or show up their staff.

Whether your involvement in testing is by invite or mandate, the ethical hacking community should commend organizations that submit
to testing, as it maybe our personal data or financial status someday that is at stake.
Let's do what we can to make sure we're not tomorrow's victims.
