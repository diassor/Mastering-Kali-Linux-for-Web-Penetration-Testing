Summary

In this chapter, we discussed some architectural concepts that may help us gain better insight into our targets.

We also discussed the various security measures our customers can put into place that we will need to be aware of, both to plan our attacks and to test for efficacy.

Our discussion also covered the importance of testing throughout the lifecycle of the application.

Doing this saves both time and money, and can certainly save the reputation and minimize risk once the application is in production.

These considerations should merit having penetration testers as a vital and permanent member of any development team.

In our next chapter, we will talk briefly about how to prepare a fully featured sandbox environment that can help us practice the test concepts.
We'll also discuss the leading test frameworks that can help us provide comprehensive test coverage.

Lastly(por ultimo), we'll discuss contracts and the ethical and legal aspects of our job;
    staying out of jail is a key objective.
